# bible-databases
This repository contains databases of the entire English Bible in some non-copyrighted versions.

Some databases (ASV, BBE, DBY, KJV, WBT, WEB, YLT) have been parsed from the SQL databases provided by [@scrollmapper](https://github.com/scrollmapper)
The BSB database has been extracted from the .xlsx file provided by [Berean Bible](https://berean.bible/downloads.htm)
